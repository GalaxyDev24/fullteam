# Notes to umar:

* /get-own-teams, /get-teams, /get-associated teams return data format needs to be unified

* Sign up with facebook, some facebook users don't have an email - need to change login flow.

* Forgot Password - Email doesn't come through. Was working previously -
  probably a server config issue? 
  Note: Luke tested recently and said it was working from the web app.

* Update player position - there is no way to do this.

# Notes to web dev:

* Privacy policy should be viewable without being logged in.
